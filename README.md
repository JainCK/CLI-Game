# CLI Game: [Riddle Game]

[![Game Demo]](./Assets/CLI.mp4)

Welcome to [Game Name]! This is a command-line interface (CLI) game created with Node.js, [clack.js](https://github.com/jlevy/clack), [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk), and [string-gradient](https://github.com/bokub/string-gradient) for styling.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
  
- **[clack.js](https://github.com/jlevy/clack):** A library for building command-line interfaces with Node.js.
  
- **[chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk):** A library for styling terminal text with colors.
  
- **[string-gradient](https://github.com/bokub/string-gradient):** A library for adding gradient color to terminal text.

## Learning Motive

Throughout this project, I've gained insights into the following:

- **Async Programming:** Leveraging asynchronous programming in Node.js using promises.
  
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Implementing game logic using classes and object-oriented concepts.
  
- **Styling CLI Output:** Enhancing the visual appeal of the CLI interface with color and gradients.
